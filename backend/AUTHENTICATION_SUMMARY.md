# Authentication System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive JWT-based authentication system with role-based access control for the BMTC Transport Tracker application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. JWT Authentication System ✅
- **JWT Token Management**: Create, verify, and manage access tokens
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing for secure password storage
- **Token Expiration**: Configurable token expiration (default: 30 minutes)
- **Role-based Access Control**: Support for passenger, driver, and admin roles

### 2. User Registration and Profile Management ✅
- **User Registration**: Email and phone number validation
- **Profile Management**: Update user information and preferences
- **Password Management**: Change password and reset functionality
- **Phone Number Validation**: Indian phone number format validation (+91XXXXXXXXXX)

### 3. Database Models
- **User Model**: Complete user entity with roles, timestamps, and security fields
- **Password Reset**: Token-based password reset with expiration
- **User Roles**: Enum-based role system (passenger, driver, admin)

### 4. API Endpoints

#### Authentication Endpoints (`/api/v1/auth/`)
- `POST /register` - User registration
- `POST /login` - User login (JSON and form-based)
- `GET /me` - Get current user information
- `POST /password-reset` - Request password reset
- `POST /password-reset/confirm` - Confirm password reset
- `POST /change-password` - Change user password
- `POST /users/{id}/activate` - Activate user (admin only)
- `POST /users/{id}/deactivate` - Deactivate user (admin only)

#### User Management Endpoints (`/api/v1/users/`)
- `GET /profile` - Get user profile
- `PUT /profile` - Update user profile
- `DELETE /profile` - Delete user profile (soft delete)
- `GET /` - List all users (admin only)
- `GET /{id}` - Get user by ID (admin only)
- `PUT /{id}` - Update user by ID (admin only)
- `DELETE /{id}` - Delete user by ID (admin only)
- `GET /role/{role}` - Get users by role (admin only)

### 5. Security Features
- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt with salt for secure password storage
- **JWT Security**: Signed tokens with configurable secret key
- **Role-based Authorization**: Middleware for protecting endpoints by role
- **Input Validation**: Pydantic schemas for request validation
- **Token Expiration**: Automatic token expiration handling

### 6. Repository Pattern
- **User Repository**: Complete CRUD operations for user management
- **Authentication Methods**: Login, password reset, token management
- **Role Management**: Methods for role-based queries and operations

### 7. Dependencies and Middleware
- **Authentication Dependencies**: Current user, admin user, driver user dependencies
- **Optional Authentication**: Support for optional authentication on public endpoints
- **Security Middleware**: HTTP Bearer token authentication

### 8. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Password hashing, JWT tokens, reset tokens
- **Integration Tests**: Complete authentication flow testing
- **Role-based Access Tests**: Verify proper access control
- **Verification Script**: Standalone verification of core functionality

## Configuration
- **JWT Settings**: Configurable secret key, algorithm, and expiration
- **Demo Mode**: Special handling for demo/development environments
- **Database**: MySQL with proper indexing for performance

## Sample Users (Demo Mode)
- **Admin**: admin@bmtc.gov.in / admin123
- **Driver 1**: driver1@bmtc.gov.in / driver123
- **Driver 2**: driver2@bmtc.gov.in / driver123
- **Passenger**: passenger@example.com / passenger123

## Security Considerations
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with salt
- JWT tokens are signed and have expiration
- Role-based access control prevents unauthorized access
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Soft delete for user accounts (deactivation instead of deletion)

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ **Requirement 9.1**: Role-based access control (passenger, driver, admin)
- ✅ **Requirement 8.1**: Driver authentication and management
- ✅ **Requirement 4.2**: User registration with phone number validation
- ✅ **Requirement 5.2**: Profile management and preferences

## Next Steps
The authentication system is ready for integration with:
- Driver portal functionality
- Admin dashboard features
- Subscription management
- Real-time location tracking
- Notification system

All authentication endpoints are secured and ready for frontend integration.
